# Introduction
Exploratory analysis highlights the extreme skewness of the distribution of
bacteria data, both here with the shellfish -related data collected by DMR, and 
with the data related to recreational beaches, collected by towns, and managed
by DEP.

Skewness means these data are difficult to analyze with any authority, and so
a degree of humility is called for in interpreting any  analyses.

Our primary goal is to be able to assess if there are important predictors of
elevated bacteria levels that we can discern, and especially to identify if
some sites are unusually vulnerable to elevated bacteria levels. 

Here we follow a strategy used in looking at the Beaches data, of looking at 
several imperfect modeling strategies to examine patterns.

The challenge is the relatively low sample sizes at each site, and the very 
heavy tails expected based on exploratory data analysis.

Other notebooks will directly address modeling of exceedences of relevant
standards, and examination of some covariates.  here we focus on site to site 
variation.

# Relevant Standards
## Growing Area Classification Standards
Growing Area Classification | Activity Allowed |	Geometric mean FC/100ml	| 90th Percentile (P90) FC/100ml
----------------------------|------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------
Approved	               | Harvesting allowed	                                                      | ≤ 14	              | ≤ 31
Conditionally Approved	 | Harvesting allowed except during specified conditions	                  | ≤ 14 in open status	| ≤ 31 in open status
Restricted	             | Depuration harvesting or relay only	                                    | ≤ 88 and >15	      | ≤ 163 and >31
Conditionally Restricted |Depuration harvesting or relay allowed except during specified conditions	| ≤ 88 in open status	| ≤ 163 in open status
Prohibited	             | Aquaculture seed production only	                                        | >88	                |>163

So, critical levels for Geometric Mean include:
$<=14$ and  $<= 88$
and for the p90
$< 31$ and $<= 163$


## Maine State Class SB Waters Standards
Maine's water quality criteria includes an additional standard, which applies
only indirectly to these data:  
> the number of enterococcus bacteria in these waters may not exceed a geometric
  mean of 8 CFU per 100   milliliters in any 90-day interval or 54 CFU per 100
  milliliters in more than 10% of the samples in any 90-day interval.
  
  38 M.R.S. §465-B(2)(B)

A "90 day interval" might apply to a summer's worth of data, but in most years 
that will only represent a handful of observations at each site. Also note that
this standard is written in terms of "enterococci", not "*E. coli* or 
"colifomes".

         Month = as.numeric(format(SDate, format = '%m'))) %>%
  mutate(Month = factor(Month, levels = 1:12, labels = month.abb))
```

### Address Censored Data
Right censored values are sufficiently rare as to be relatively unimportant
we leave the undressed, but address left censored values.  Interval Censored 
values add complexity, but are unlikely in our setting to sharply alter 
qualitative conclusions, so we chose not to address them.

We first calculate a estimated conditional mean to replace the (left) censored
values. The algorithm is not entirely appropriate, as it assumes lognormal
distribution, and our data are closer to Pareto-distributed.  Still, it handles
the non-detects on a more rational basis than the usual conventions.

Second, we calculate a version of the data where non-detects are replaced by
half the value of the detection limit.  However, we plan to use the LOG of
*E. coli* counts in Gamma GLM models, which require response variables to be 
strictly positive. The most common Reporting Limit in these data is `RL == 2`. 
Half of that is 1.0, and `log(1.0) == 0`.  Consequently, we replace all 
values 1.0 with 1.1, as log(1.1) is positive, and thus can be modeled by
a gamm GLM.

As a reminder, `ColiVal` simply includes the censored values at their reporting 
limit, providing a third alternative for handling non-detects.
```{r}
coli_data <- coli_data %>%
  mutate(ColiVal_ml = sub_cmeans(ColiVal, LCFlag)) %>%
  mutate(ColiVal_hf = if_else(LCFlag, ColiVal/2, ColiVal),
         ColiVal_hf = if_else(ColiVal_hf == 1, 1.1, ColiVal_hf))
```

```{r}
ggplot(coli_data, aes(x = ColiVal, y = ColiVal_ml, color = LCFlag)) +
  geom_point() +
  xlim(0,25) +
  ylim(0,25)
```

Almost all censored values were at 2
```{r}
coli_data %>%
  filter(ColiVal == 2, LCFlag) %>%
  pull(ColiVal_ml) %>%
  summary
```
So, our (lognormal) based estimator for censored values estimates a non-detect 
at somewhere around 0.61 CF per 100 ml.  Because data has substantially heavier
tails than a lognormal distribution, that estimate is probably an overestimate 
of more realistic conditional expectation.

### Remove NAs
```{r}
coli_data <- coli_data %>%
  filter (! is.na(ColiVal))
```

## Weather Data
We simplify the weather data somewhat.

```{r load_weather_data}
sibfldnm    <- 'Original_Data'
parent      <- dirname(getwd())
sibling     <- file.path(parent,sibfldnm)

fn <- "Portland_Jetport_2015-2019.csv"
fpath <- file.path(sibling, fn)

weather_data <- read_csv(fpath, 
 col_types = cols(AWNDattr = col_skip(), 
        FMTM = col_skip(), FMTMattr = col_skip(), 
        PGTM = col_skip(), PGTMattr = col_skip(),
        PRCPattr = col_character(), SNOWattr = col_character(), 
        SNWD = col_skip(), SNWDattr = col_skip(),
        TAVG = col_number(), TAVGattr = col_character(), 
        TMIN = col_number(), TMINattr = col_character(), 
        TMAX = col_number(), TMAXattr = col_character(), 
        station = col_skip())) %>%
  select( ! starts_with('W')) %>%
  select(! ends_with('attr')) %>%
  rename(sdate = date,
         Precip=PRCP,
         MaxT = TMAX,
         MinT= TMIN,
         AvgT = TAVG,
         Snow = SNOW) %>%
  mutate(sdate = as.Date(sdate, format = '%m/%d/%Y'))
```


```{r}
weather_data <- weather_data %>%
  arrange(sdate) %>%
  
  select(sdate, Precip, AvgT, MaxT) %>%
  mutate(AvgT = AvgT / 10,
         MaxT = MaxT / 10,
         Precip = Precip / 10,
         Precip_d1 = dplyr::lag(Precip,1),
         Precip_d2 = dplyr::lag(Precip,2),
         Log1Precip    = log1p(Precip), 
         Log1Precip_d1 = log1p(Precip_d1),
         Log1Precip_d2 = log1p(Precip_d2),
         Log1Precip_2   = log1p(Precip_d1 + Precip_d2),
         Log1Precip_3   = log1p(Precip + Precip_d1 + Precip_d2))
```

## Incorporate Weather Data
```{r}
coli_data <- coli_data %>%
  left_join(weather_data, by = c('SDate' = 'sdate'))
```

## Remove Sites not in Region
We have some data that was selected for stations outside of Casco Bay. To be  
careful, we  remove sampling data for any site in th two adjacent Growing Areas,
"WH" and "WM".
```{r}
coli_data <- coli_data %>%
  filter(GROW_AREA != 'WH' & GROW_AREA != "WM") %>%
  mutate(GROW_AREA = fct_drop(GROW_AREA))
```



# Preliminary Graphics
## Histogram

**Critical levels (Reminder)**  
Geometric Mean include:  
$<=14$ and  $<= 88$  
and for the p90  
$< 31$ and $<= 16$   

```{r histograms, fig.width = 7}
ggplot(coli_data, aes(ColiVal_ml)) +
  geom_histogram(fill = cbep_colors()[5]) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 14, lty = 3, col = 'blue') +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 31, lty = 2, col = 'blue') +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 88, lty = 3) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 163, lty = 2) +
  scale_x_log10() +

  theme_cbep(base_size = 10)
```
As for the Beaches data:  
1.  Non detects are highly abundant.  
2.  Violations of standards are relatively rare.   

(Dotted lines apply to Geometric Mean; Dashed lines apply to P90. Roughly
speaking, the Blue lines are for the boundary between open and restricted, black
lines are for the boundary between restricted and prohibited.)


```{r histograms_double_log, fig.width = 7}
ggplot(coli_data, aes(ColiVal_ml)) +
  geom_histogram(fill = cbep_colors()[5]) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 14, lty = 3, col = 'blue') +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 31, lty = 2, col = 'blue') +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 88, lty = 3) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 163, lty = 2) +
  scale_x_log10() +
  scale_y_log10() +

  theme_cbep(base_size = 10)
```
And that looks very much like a linear relationship on a log-log plot,
suggesting a gamma or Pareto distribution is appropriate.  Prior exploratory 
analysis suggests a Pareto Distribution is better, but that adds considerable
complexity to interpreting model results because of the available modeling 
tools.

## Pareto Fit?
```{r pareto_fit}
paretofit = vglm(ColiVal_ml~ 1, paretoII(location = 0) , data = coli_data)
parms <- exp(coef(paretofit))
names(parms) <- c('Scale', 'Shape')
parms
#predict(paretofit, newdata = data.frame(x = 1))
```

```{r plot_pareto_fit}
ggplot(coli_data,aes(x = ColiVal_ml)) +
  geom_histogram(aes( y = ..density..)) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 14, lty = 3, col = 'blue') +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 31, lty = 2, col = 'blue') +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 88, lty = 3) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 163, lty = 2) +
  scale_x_log10() +
  scale_y_log10() +

  theme_cbep(base_size = 10) +
  
  geom_function(fun = dparetoII,
                 args = list(location = 0,
                             scale = parms[[1]],
                             shape = parms[[2]]),
                 color = 'red')
```

So we have a scaling problem, but the overall pattern does not look wildly
inappropriate....

## Simple Time Plot
### Create Geometric Mean Function
```{r gm_mean_function}
gm_mean <- function(x) {
  exp(mean(log(x), na.rm = TRUE))
}
```


```{r}
gm_mean(coli_data$ColiVal_ml)
tmp <- coli_data %>%
  group_by(YEAR) %>%
  summarize(gm = gm_mean(ColiVal_ml))
tmp
```


### Plot
```{r time_plots, fig.width = 7}
ggplot(coli_data, aes(YEAR, ColiVal_ml)) +
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.5) +
  ## We use the MEAN here because `stat_summary()` works on data after
  ## applying the transformation to the y axis, thus implicitly calculating the
  ## geometric mean.
  stat_summary(fun = mean, fill = 'red', shape = 23) +
  ## The hand calculated points match, so are unneeded.
  ## geom_point(data = tmp, mapping = aes(YEAR, gm), color = 'blue', size = 3) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 14, lty = 3, col = 'blue') +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 31, lty = 2, col = 'blue') +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 88, lty = 3) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 163, lty = 2) +

  scale_y_log10() +

  theme_cbep(base_size = 10)
```

# Data Summaries
```{r summaries}
cat('\nNon-detects at Detection Limit\n')
summary(coli_data$ColiVal)
cat('\n     Geometric Mean\n')
exp(mean(log(coli_data$ColiVal)))
cat('\n\n')

cat('\nNon-detects at maximum likelihood estimator\n')
summary(coli_data$ColiVal_ml)
cat('\n     Geometric Mean\n')
exp(mean(log(coli_data$ColiVal_ml)))

```

Note that the medians are right at the detection limits (or our re-casting of
those to handle non-detects).  Also, the 75th percentile is at 4.0, just double 
the detection limit, and probably the next available value under the MPN 
method.

## Summary Statistics Dataframe
```{r}
sum_data <- coli_data %>%
  mutate(logcoli = log(ColiVal),
         logcoli2 = log(ColiVal_ml)) %>%
  group_by(Station) %>%
  summarize(mean1 = mean(ColiVal),
            median1 = median(ColiVal),
            iqr1 = IQR(ColiVal),
            p901 = quantile(ColiVal, 0.9),
            meanlog1 = mean(logcoli, na.rm = TRUE),
            sdlog1 = sd(logcoli, na.rm = TRUE),
            nlog1 = sum(! is.na(logcoli)),
            selog1 = sdlog1/sqrt(nlog1),
            gmean1 = exp(meanlog1),
            U_CI1 = exp(meanlog1 + 1.96 * selog1),
            L_CI1 = exp(meanlog1 - 1.96 * selog1),
            
            mean2 = mean(ColiVal_ml),
            median2 = median(ColiVal_ml),
            iqr2 = IQR(ColiVal_ml),
            p902 = quantile(ColiVal_ml, 0.9),
            meanlog2 = mean(logcoli2, na.rm = TRUE),
            sdlog2 = sd(logcoli2, na.rm = TRUE),
            nlog2 = sum(! is.na(logcoli2)),
            selog2 = sdlog1/sqrt(nlog2),
            gmean2 = exp(meanlog2),
            U_CI2 = exp(meanlog2 + 1.96 * selog2),
            L_CI2 = exp(meanlog2 - 1.96 * selog2)) %>%
  mutate(Station = fct_reorder(Station, gmean2))

```

                                          linetype = 2)) 

plt
```

Note the scaling of naive 95% CIs with scale.

# Modeling
Overall, we focus on models that explore differences among sampling stations.
Under that principal goal, we examine:

1.  Impact of rainfall on those station by station estimates; 
2.  Examination of  differences among DMR Growing Areas, as a convenient summary
    for regional patterns
4.  Seasonal patterns.

Modeling here emphasizes understanding of patterns, not estimation, as results
in State  of Casco Bay will emphasize observed metrics, like geometric means.

We use three different methods: linear models, gamma generalized linear models, 
and hierarchical models, developed through GAMs with random effects. 

## Simple Log Linear Model
Although we think a simple linear model is inappropriate given the highly skewed 
data, we look at it anyway as a starting point for analysis.
```{r plot_simple_lm}
test_lm <- lm(log(ColiVal_ml) ~ Station, data = coli_data)
plot(test_lm)
```
The model fails to address extreme values.  You see clear relationships between 
location and scale.  Some of the pattern reflects the discrete nature of the 
lower observations.  A better model might need t explicitly model interval
censored data.

```{r}
anova(test_lm)
```
As suspected, the comparisons are highly significant.  Stations differ.

We have a significant challenge here figuring out how to address or even
display what are essentially thousands of pairwise comparisons.  We use 
`emmeans()` as a convenient way to extract station by station estimates and
standard errors.  We use `type = 'response'` to generate estimated geometric 
means an 95% confidence intervals.

```{r}
emms <- summary(emmeans(test_lm, "Station", type = 'response')) %>%
  arrange(response) %>%
  mutate(Station =fct_reorder(Station, response)) %>%
  rename(geom_mean = response) %>%
  as_tibble()
```

### Graphic
```{r plot_lm_emms, fig.height = 7}
plt <- ggplot(emms, aes(geom_mean, Station)) + 
  geom_pointrange(aes(xmin = lower.CL, xmax = upper.CL),
                  color = cbep_colors()[4],
                  size = .2) +
 
  scale_x_log10(breaks = c(1,3,10,30, 100)) +
  
  xlab('Geometric Mean E. coli \n(MPN CFU/100 ml)') +
  ylab('Location') +
  
  theme_cbep(base_size = 12) + 
  theme(axis.text.y = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.y = element_blank(),
        axis.line  = element_line(size = 0.5, 
                                  color = 'gray85'),
        panel.grid.major.x = element_line(size = 0.5, 
                                          color = 'gray85', 
                                          linetype = 2)) 

plt
```
So only one site has estimated long-term geometric mean that exceeds the
geometric mean standard between

```{r}
plt +
  stat_summary(fun = mean, mapping = aes(x=ColiVal_ml, y=Station), 
               data = coli_data,
               fill = 'red', shape = 23)
```

So our model regenerates the observed geometric means, as expected.

## Linear Rainfall Model
Most likely, a rainfall predictor would be useful.  We assemble rainfall data
based on NOAA weather data.  Rainfall data is **also** highly skewed, so we 
focus on the and look at the log of rainfall.  Our predictors are log of the
prior day's rainfall, the log of the current day's rainfall, and the log of from the prior two 
days.

We have multiple possible predictors. If we take them one at a time, which is 
best?
```{r rain_lm_compare}
rain_lm_1 <- lm(log(ColiVal_ml) ~ Station + Log1Precip,  data = coli_data)
rain_lm_2 <- lm(log(ColiVal_ml) ~ Station + Log1Precip_d1,  data = coli_data)
rain_lm_3 <- lm(log(ColiVal_ml) ~ Station + Log1Precip_d2,  data = coli_data)
rain_lm_4 <- lm(log(ColiVal_ml) ~ Station + Log1Precip + Log1Precip_d1,
                data = coli_data)
rain_lm_5 <- lm(log(ColiVal_ml) ~ Station + Log1Precip + 
                  Log1Precip_d1 + Log1Precip_d2,
                data = coli_data)
```

```{r}
anova(rain_lm_1, rain_lm_2, rain_lm_3, rain_lm_4, rain_lm_5)
rm(rain_lm_1, rain_lm_2, rain_lm_3, rain_lm_4, rain_lm_5)

```
Rainfall is highly significant.  The best single predictor is based on the 
previous day's rainfall 9Model 2) adding the current day's rainfall helps a bit
more.  Including the current day's rainfall also helps.
but the reduction in sums of squares.

```{r rain_lm}
rain_lm <- lm(log(ColiVal_ml) ~ Station + Log1Precip + 
                Log1Precip_d1, data = coli_data)
```

```{r}
summary(rain_lm)$coefficients[239:240,]
```
So conditions are more dependent on the prior day's rainfall.  

#### Extract Adjusted Station by Station Estimates
Note that we specify marginal means calculated for a day without 
rainfall, rather than for a day with "average" rainfall, which would be higher, 
or a day with median rainfall. We could have used `cov.reduce = median`, since 
median rainfall **was** zero, but that could lead to inconsistent models with
other data.  
```{r}
emms <- summary(emmeans(rain_lm, "Station", type = 'response',
                        at = list(LogPrecip_d1 = 0, LogPrecip = 0))) %>%
  arrange(response) %>%
  mutate(Station =fct_reorder(Station, response)) %>%
  rename(geom_mean = response) %>%
  as_tibble()
```

#### Check Relationship with Geometric Means
```{r}
plt +
  stat_summary(fun = mean, mapping = aes(x=ColiVal_ml, y=Station), 
               data = coli_data,
               fill = 'red', shape = 23)
```
The match is not perfect anymore, as expected since the MLEs now are corrected
for recent rainfall, but the correlation is close.  Note that the confidence
intervals are wider than the scatter among geometric means, so differences 
among sites dominate, but rainfall still matters.

## Selection of GLM Family
Preliminary analyses suggested that models were more successful predicting
the log of bacteria levels.  Bacteria levels appear to be distributed close to a
(censored) Pareto distribution.

Modeling based on log transformed data has the advantage of meaning our models
readily generate geometric means, to which the regulations are linked.

Even after log-transformation, however, our data is highly skewed, so we need a 
GLM that can handle skewed data.  Usually, gamma and inverse Gaussian GLMs are 
recommended for skewed (positive continuous) data. 

We explored both gamma GLMs and inverse Gaussian GLMs.  Both can handle skewed 
data but are restricted to  data that ranges over the positive real numbers. For 
the negative binomial GLMs, we examined several link functions, (1/mu^2,
inverse, identity). Results for all alternative GLMs were qualitatively similar.  

The inverse Gaussian models perform relatively poorly (based on model diagnostic 
plots), so we focus on models based on the Gamma GLM (or Gamma GAM).

Log transform of counts are positive, except for count = 0, where the log is
undefined.  (Given our interest in interpreting results in terms of the geometric
mean, we do not want to add one to all counts to avoid zeros.) 

The effect is that we are restricted with regards to how we handle 
non-detects.  There are several conventions regarding appropriate analysis of 
non-detects:

1.  Replace non-detects with their reporting limits;  
2.  Replace non-detects with zero;  
3.  Replace non-detects with half the reporting limit;  
4.  Replace non-detects with a statistically-based estimate of missing values.

While we generally prefer (4), we can not use that here, as reasonable MLE
estimates of the conditional means of (unobserved) non-detects are below 1,
which would lead to negative logs.  Similarly, we can not go with (2).  Both
(1) and (3) are viable alternatives.  (1) uses `ColiVal', and (3) uses
`ColiVal_hf`.  

We found, however, that the gamma GLM can not readily handle the log of our
count data if we replace our non-detects by the value 1 (which is half the
reporting limit).  The reason, of course, is that `log(1) == 0`, and the
canonical link function for a gamma GLM is the inverse, so the value of 1
returns an infinite link function, making teh GLM model unstable.  Even when we
replace `ND <- 1` with `ND <- 1.1`, the GLM has trouble fitting some fairly
simple models.

We therefore largely fall back on alternative (1), which we usually avoid.
Again, qualitative results do not change much, but model stability improves.

## Simple Gamma GLM
Note that we are NOT using  non-detect corrected data here, because it includes
values below 1, which leads to log of values below 0, which the gamma models
can not handle.
```{r gamma_glm}
gamma_glm <- glm(log(ColiVal) ~ Station, 
                family = Gamma(), 
                data = coli_data)
```

```{r diagnostics_gamma_glm}
boot::glm.diag.plots(gamma_glm)
```
That addresses the extreme values more successfully than our linear models, but
not entirely. The scale-location relationship remains, but has been reduced in
importance and partially reversed.

```{r}
emms <- summary(emmeans(gamma_glm, "Station", type = 'response')) %>%
  arrange(response) %>%
  mutate(Station =fct_reorder(Station, response)) %>%
  rename(geom_mean = response) %>%
  as_tibble()
```

#### Graphic
```{r plot_glm_emms, fig.height = 7}
plt <- ggplot(emms, aes(geom_mean, Station)) + 
  geom_pointrange(aes(xmin = asymp.LCL, xmax = asymp.UCL),
                  color = cbep_colors()[4],
                  size = .2) +
  scale_x_log10(breaks = c(1,3,10,30, 100)) +
  
  xlab('Geometric Mean E. coli \n(MPN CFU/100 ml)') +
  ylab('Location') +
  
  theme_cbep(base_size = 12) + 
  theme(axis.text.y = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.y = element_blank(),
        axis.line  = element_line(size = 0.5, 
                                  color = 'gray85'),
        panel.grid.major.x = element_line(size = 0.5, 
                                          color = 'gray85', 
                                          linetype = 2)) 

plt
```
Qualitatively, that is similar to results from the linear model, with confidence 
intervals that scale with the geometric means, which makes sense both with
these data and with a gamma model.

```{r plot_glm_emms_2, fig.height = 7}
plt +
   stat_summary(fun = mean, mapping = aes(x=ColiVal, y=Station), 
                data = coli_data,
                fill = 'red', shape = 23)
```
So the the predicted values still match the observed geometric means.  Note that
these geometric means are slightly higher than the ones produced by fitting 
our non-detect corrected data, or fitting the version with non-detects scaled
to half the nominal reporting limit, since we are replacing the non-detects
with their reporting limits here.

## Inverse Gaussian GLM
```{r inverse_gaussian_glm}
ig_glm <- glm(log(ColiVal) ~ Station, 
                family = inverse.gaussian(), 
                data = coli_data)
```

```{r diagnostics_ig_glm}
boot::glm.diag.plots(ig_glm)
```

The inverse Gaussian GLMs do slightly better addressing the location-scale
relationship.  But residuals are larger, more heavily skewed, and contain a
"kink" that apparently depends on how we handle the non-detects. We prefer the 
gamma models, and continue examining only those models.

## Rainfall Gaussian GLM
We focus on a model that includes information on rainfall from the prior day and 
the day of sampling (guided by our linear model analysis).
```{r rain_glm}
rain_glm <- glm(log(ColiVal) ~ Station + Log1Precip + 
                Log1Precip_d1, 
                family = Gamma(), 
                data = coli_data)
```

```{r diagnostics_rain_glm}
boot::glm.diag.plots(rain_glm)
```
That leaves us with a distribution of residuals with a light lower tail, but
we also create some moderately high leverage values, and increase a few 
elevated residuals.  Judging by what we saw in the Beaches data, those elevated
residuals probably arise because of high values that do not correspond to high 
rainfall, or moderate levels that correspond to very high rainfall.

```{r}
summary(rain_glm)$coefficients[239:240,]
```
Previous day's precipitation has more effect on current conditions than
present-day precipitation. (Note that because the link function here is an 
inverse, a negative value implies the response is increasing).

### Results
Note this is the first place our selection of how we specify marginal means
are likely to be important.  We fit for days with 0 recent rainfall. 
```{r}
emms2 <- summary(emmeans(rain_glm, "Station", type = 'response',
                        at = list(LogPrecip_d1 = 0, LogPrecip = 0))) %>%
  arrange(response) %>%
  mutate(Station = fct_reorder(Station, response),
         GROW_AREA = coli_data$GROW_AREA[match(Station, coli_data$Station)]) %>%
  rename(geom_mean = response) %>%
  as_tibble()
```

### Graphic
We add colors by DMR Grow Region.  This makes the graphic more confusing. It
shows clear differences among regions, so it was worth trying.
```{r plot_rainfall_emms, fig.height = 7}
plt <- ggplot(emms2, aes(geom_mean, Station)) + 
  geom_pointrange(aes(xmin = asymp.LCL, xmax = asymp.UCL, color = GROW_AREA),
                  #color = cbep_colors()[4],
                  size = .2) +
  
  scale_x_log10(breaks = c(1,3,10,30, 100)) +
  
  xlab('Geometric Mean E. coli \n(MPN CFU/100 ml)') +
  ylab('Location') +
  
  scale_color_manual(values = cbep_colors()) +
  theme_cbep(base_size = 12) + 
  theme(axis.text.y = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.y = element_blank(),
        axis.line  = element_line(size = 0.5, 
                                  color = 'gray85'),
        panel.grid.major.x = element_line(size = 0.5, 
                                          color = 'gray85', 
                                          linetype = 2)) 

plt
```
Qualitatively, that is similar to results from the prior model.

```{r plot_glm_rain_with_geom_means, fig.height = 7}
plt +
   stat_summary(fun = mean, mapping = aes(x=ColiVal, y=Station), 
                data = coli_data,
                fill = 'red', shape = 23)
```

In this case, our estimated marginal means shifted below the observed 
geometric means.  This is expected, as we have chosen to estimate marginal
means for a day with no recent rainfall.  The effect is fairly large for a few 
high geometric mean sites.  It's not clear if that is a modeling artifact 
or reflects the possibility that sites with higher geometric means were (by 
chance?) sampled more after rain.

## Growing Regions GAM
We clearly have a hierarchical model here, with Stations nested within Growing
Areas.  It is appropriate to treat the Stations (in this setting) as random
factors within Growing Areas. So we fit this as a GAM model, using a random 
effects smoother.A functionally similar model could be fit with `lme()` or
`lmer()`
```{r grow_gam}
grow_gam <- gam(log(ColiVal) ~ GROW_AREA + s(Station, bs = 're'), 
                family = Gamma(), 
                data = coli_data)
```

```{r}
anova(grow_gam)
```
We see that grow area is a statistically significant predictor of geometric mean
levels of *E. coli* at the different stations.

###  Plot
```{r}
plot(grow_gam)
```
This plot shows the magnitude of the random effects.  IDeally, these residuals
should be close to normally distributed.  here we note that they are somewhat
skewed, but not excessively so.

```{r}
summary(grow_gam)
```

Because the link function is the inverse, a lower value here implies a 
higher geometric mean. The default base case here is `GROW_AREA == "HI"`.
That is the highest bacteria region, with the other regions showing generally
lower concentrations.  Pairwise coefficients are not individually 
significant (or in one case marginally so).
```{r}
myemms <- emmeans(grow_gam, "GROW_AREA",
                         nesting = "Station %in% GROW_AREA")

pwpp(myemms)
rm(myemms)
```
So, in pairwise comparisons, "WI" has lower linear predictor (higher response) 
than all the other sites.  In addition.," "WK" is significantly worse off than
"WJ" and nearly significantly worse of f than "WL".

(Results are less clear cut if we analyze ColiVal_hf, where we replace 
non-detects by half their value, but  then the model is unstable.)

```{r}
emms3 <- summary(emmeans(grow_gam, "GROW_AREA", type = 'response',
                         nesting = "Station %in% GROW_AREA")) %>%
  arrange(response) %>%
  rename(geom_mean = response) %>%
  as_tibble()
emms3
```
Note that although we have statistically significant differences among regions,
the actual bacteria levels are low, and differences are quantitatively small.
Error bars on the estimated geometric means are smaller than the plotting 
symbols.


### Graphic
```{r plot_grow_emms, fig.width = 6}
plt <- ggplot(emms3, aes(GROW_AREA, geom_mean)) + 
  geom_jitter(data = coli_data, mapping = aes(x = GROW_AREA, 
                                             y = ColiVal,
                                             color = LCFlag),

  xlab('DMR Growing Area') +
  
  theme_cbep(base_size = 12) +
  theme(legend.position = 'bottom')

plt
```

## Seasonal Model
We chose to use a hierarchical mixed model here as well, because measurements 
collected at any single Station are correlated.  This makes the model akin to a 
repeated measures model. An equivalent model could be fit with `lmer()` or 
`lme()`.
```{r month_gam}
month_gam <- gam(log(ColiVal) ~ Month + s(Station, bs = 're'), 
                family = Gamma(), 
                data = coli_data)
```

This model failed to converge cleanly when fit against `ColiVal_hf`.  
We do not see those problems when fitting the uncorrected data, as here.  That
suggests that our model (a gamma fit, with inverse link on log transformed
data) has trouble with fitting the values of the non-detects when we replace 
non-detects with a value of 1.

Those warnings suggest problems with convergence.  That is not all that
surprising, since both rainfall and *E. coli* levels are highly skewed -- and
the correlations between them, while important, are not perfect.

```{r diagnostics_month_2_gam}
plot(month_gam)
```
The random effects are again skewed.


```{r}
summary(month_gam)
```
The summary shows a strong seasonal pattern, with winter months with generally
high coefficients ( == low geometric means), that are significantly different
from conditions in the late summer and fall.

### Pairwise Comparisons
```{r}
myemms <- emmeans(month_gam, "Month")

pwpp(myemms) 
rm(myemms)
```
The overall pattern is that June through November tend to not differ (although
each of those two months are sometimes different from one or another month).
December through May also tend to not differ, 


### Results
```{r, emm_month}
emms4 <- summary(emmeans(month_gam, "Month", type = 'response',
                        at = list(LogPrecip_d1 = 0, LogPrecip = 0))) %>%
  rename(geom_mean = response) %>%
  as_tibble()
emms4
```
Again, note how low the geometric means are.

### Graphic
```{r plot_month_emms, fig.width = 6}
plt <- ggplot(emms4, aes(Month, geom_mean)) + 
  geom_jitter(data = coli_data, mapping = aes(x = Month, 
                                             y = ColiVal,
                                             color = LCFlag),
              alpha = 0.25) +
  geom_line(aes(x = as.numeric(Month)), color = 'red') +
  geom_pointrange(aes(ymin = lower.CL, ymax = upper.CL),
                  color = 'red', size = .75, shape = 17) +
 
  scale_y_log10() +
  scale_color_manual(values = cbep_colors(), name = '', 
                     labels = c('Observed', 'Below Detection')) +
  ylab('Geometric Mean E. coli \n(MPN CFU/100 ml)') +
  xlab('DMR Growing Area') +
  
  theme_cbep(base_size = 12) +
  theme(legend.position = 'bottom')

plt
```

```{r}
plt +
   stat_summary(fun = mean, mapping = aes(y=ColiVal, x=Month), 
                data = coli_data,
                fill = 'yellow', shape = 23)
```

Estimated values are not exactly equal to observed geometric means.  That is
expected, since the model estimates are corrected for sampling histories of
different Stations.

## Full Seasonal (DOY) model
We fit a cyclic smoother to the Day of the Year.  Selection
of the degree of smoothing is a bit of an arbitrary call, but we
generally prefer to underfit rather than overfit GAM smoothers.  The default 
fit used almost eight degrees of freedom, and it fit what looked like a few too 
many wiggles for a reasonable seasonal pattern.  We try six knots, for a 
slightly smoother fit.
```{r DOY_gam}
doy_gam <- gam(log(ColiVal) ~ s(DOY, k = 6, bs = 'cc') + s(Station, bs = 're'), 
                family = Gamma(), 
                data = coli_data)
```


Recall that the linear predictor for our gamma GLM is the inverse.
```{r}
plot(doy_gam)
```

```{r}
summary(doy_gam)
```

We want to compare predicted values and standard errors to observed values.
I can use predict to get estimates, but I have to get  them for all stations
and average, requiring dubious use of weighted sum to generate an estimated 
standard error.
```{r}
s <- unique(coli_data$Station)
l = length(s)
df <- data.frame(DOY = rep(1:365, l), Station = rep(s, each = 365))

p <- predict(doy_gam, newdata = df)
```


```{r}
p <- tibble(fit = p) %>%
  mutate(DOY = rep(1:365, l), 
         Station = rep(s, each = 365)) %>%
  group_by(DOY) %>%
  summarize(mean_lp = mean(fit),
            sd_lp = sd(fit),
            mean_response = 1/mean_lp,
            upper_response = 1/(mean_lp + 1.96* sd_lp),
            lower_response = 1/(mean_lp - 1.96* sd_lp),
            gmean = exp(mean_response),
            upper_gmean = exp(upper_response),
            lower_gmean = exp(lower_response))
```

## Pareto Models
We were unable to run a Pareto models successfully under `VGAM`.
```{r pareto_glm, error = TRUE}
tmp <- coli_data %>%
  filter (! is.na(ColiVal))
pareto_vglm <- vglm(ColiVal ~ Station, 
                    paretoII, data = tmp,
                    maxit = 50)
anova.vglm(pareto_vglm)
rm(tmp)
```

## Nonparametric Tests
We proceed to a nonparametric analysis. This is useful for a one way analysis, 
but does not lend itself to testing more complex models.
```{r kruskal_test}
kruskal.test(ColiVal_ml ~ Station, data = coli_data)
```
Although the Kruskal-Wallis test is not strictly a comparison of medians, it's 
close, so we look at medians. 
```{r summary_again}
coli_data %>%
  mutate(Station = fct_reorder(Station, ColiVal_ml)) %>%
  group_by(Station) %>%
  summarize(Median = median(ColiVal_ml),
            iqr = IQR(ColiVal_ml),
            p90 = quantile(ColiVal_ml, .9)) %>%
  
  ggplot(aes(Median, Station)) +
  geom_point() +

  scale_x_log10() + 

  theme_cbep(base_size = 12) + 
  theme(axis.text.y = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.y = element_blank(),
        axis.line  = element_line(size = 0.5, 
                                  color = 'gray85'),
        panel.grid.major.x = element_line(size = 0.5, 
                                          color = 'gray85', 
                                          linetype = 2))
```

Note how many of those medians are at discrete values determined by the methods
involved.  **Most** sites **almost always** are below detection limits or
at very low levels.

### Pairwise Wilcoxon test
Although a pairwise analysis is possible, it is not very informative with so 
many stations.

The following is moderately slow.... Many warnings are produced, all saying 
exact p values are not possible with tied values -- of which we have many.

The giant cross classification matrix is hard to parse, so this is not 
especially useful without a lot more work.  WE don't need it, as results will
generally confirm that some Stations are different from others, which we know. 
```{r wilcox, warnings = FALSE}
res <- suppressWarnings(

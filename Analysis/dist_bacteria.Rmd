# Introduction
As part of exploratory data analysis, and specifically to provide insight into
how best to handle non-detects and censored values, we want to understand the
distribution of observations in the *E. coli* shellfish bacteria data.  Here we
take a look at overall data distributions, to consider possible modeling
strategies. Since the data distribution may also be shaped by the distribution
of predictors, this analysis is exploratory only, and any distributional
assumptions need to be confirmed in the model context.

# Load Data

sibfldnm <- 'Derived_Data'
parent <- dirname(getwd())

path <- file.path(sibling, fl1)

  mutate(DOY = as.numeric(format(SDate, format = '%j')),
         Month = as.numeric(format(SDate, format = '%m')))
```

## Address Censored Data
Right censored values are sufficiently rare as to be relatively unimportant
we leave the undressed, but address left censored values.  Interval Censored 
values add complexity, but are unlikely in our setting to sharply alter 
qualitative conclusions, so we chose not to address them.
```{r}
coli_data <- coli_data %>%
  mutate(ColiVal_2 = sub_cmeans(ColiVal, LCFlag))
```

```{r}
ggplot(coli_data, aes(x = ColiVal, y = ColiVal_2, color = LCFlag)) +
  geom_point() +
  xlim(0,25) +
  ylim(0,25)
```
Almost all censored values were at 2
```{r}
coli_data %>%
  filter(ColiVal == 2, LCFlag) %>%
  pull(ColiVal_2) %>%
  summary
```
So, our (lognormal) based estimator for censored values estimates a non-detect 
at somewhere around 0.61 CF per 100 ml.  

## Remove NAs
```{r}
coli_data <- coli_data %>%
  filter (! is.na(ColiVal))
```

# Dealing with Skewed Data
The data is so highly skewed that even the logs are skewed, which suggests we
may have a hard time finding a parametric way of analyzing these data.

Given the non-detects and censored upper values, we can consider 
1. Fitting data to a parametric family of distributions, accounting for censoring
2. Robust or resistant statistical methods
3. Non-parametric methods 


## Analytic Graphics
The package 'fitdistrplus' provides functions for fitting standard as well as non-standard distributions both with and without censored data.  We test it 
first without accounting for censoring.
```{r}
test_dat <- coli_data %>%
  filter(! is.na(ColiVal)) %>%
  select(ColiVal, LCFlag, RCFlag)
plotdist(test_dat$ColiVal, histo = TRUE, demp = TRUE)
```

The package contains and interesting function that provides a graphical
representation of data in terms of kurtosis and skewness.  The output is helpful
for evaluating potential alternative data distributions.
```{r}
descdist(test_dat$ColiVal, boot = 1000)
```
That plot confirms that the data has heavier tails than either lognormal or
gamma distributions  A Beta distribution is not appropriate, since Beta variates
are bounded between zero and one.  We need a highly skewed, heavy-tailed
distribution with a support on the positive real line.

```{r}
descdist(log(test_dat$ColiVal), boot = 1000)
```
even log-transformed data is problematic to model. It is significantly more skew
than an exponential or gamma distribution.

## Gamma Distribution
Gamma can be fit by the method of moments, with parameters Shape = $\alpha$ and
Scale = $\theta$.  The mean and variance are as follows:
$$\mu=\alpha\theta$$
$$\sigma^2 = \alpha \theta^2$$


The estimates of the parameters therefore are:
$$\theta = \alpha ^ 2 /μ$$


$$\alpha = \mu / \theta= \mu^2 / \sigma^2$$

The empirical moments are:
```{r}
(a <- with(coli_data, list(mean=mean(ColiVal_2, na.rm=TRUE),
                           var=var(ColiVal_2, na.rm=TRUE))))
```

So, by the method of moments, we can examine a gamma distribution with the following parameters:
```{r}
(theta = a$var/a$mean)
(alpha = a$mean/theta)
```

## Pareto Distribution
### What is the Pareto Distribution?
The Pareto distribution is an extreme value distribution.  The Pareto
distribution comes in several flavors.  The one we are focusing on is a three 
parameter family, with Location, Scale and Shape parameters.  The first is 
often treated as known in an estimation context.  The latter two must be
positive.  This version of the Pareto distribution is often described as the 
"Pareto(II)" distribution, or when Location == 0, as the "Lomax" distribution.
Wikipedia includes a discussion of this distribution under "Generalized
Pareto Distribution", but with different parameterization.

The "classic" Pareto Distribution (a two parameter version of Pareto(II), with 
`Location == Scale`) ends up looking linear on a log-log plot.  Other versions
are close to linear.  This property (shared with the Gamma distribution)
suggests the Pareto may be a good bet for the bacteria data, which looks similar 
(if you ignore censoring).

The Pareto distribution can be fit a several ways.  First and second moments 
have relatively simple closed form values, so parameters could be estimated 
using either the method of moments, or maximum likelihood methods.


###  Means and Variances
#### Mean

$$E(x) = \frac{\sigma}{\alpha - 1} + \mu $$

Where parameters are: 
*  Location = $\mu$  (The minimum of the distribution; 0 for a "Lomax" 
    distribution)   
*  Shape = $\alpha$ and   
*  Scale = $/sigma$  

Mean goes UP with the scale parameter, and DOWN with the shape parameter.

#### Variance
The variance is a little trickier.  Different parameterizations from
different packages and references are confusing. It appears that (using our
notation so far) variance is:


$$ Var(x) = E((x -E(x))^2) = \frac{\sigma^2 \alpha} {(\alpha - 1)^2(\alpha - 2))} \quad (\alpha > 1)  $$
Variance is undefined for $\alpha < 1$ and infinite for $\alpha < 2$.

Generally, variance goes UP with the scale parameter, and DOWN with the shape
parameter.

### Pareto Distribution Functions in R
The Pareto distribution is not available in vanilla R, although it is available
in many packages. See (https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Distributions.html).
We examined versions from `actuar`, `EnvStats` and `VGAM`.  The implementations
are slightly different. Confusingly, the names of the parameters of the
distribution are inconsistent from package to package, and even within the
`VGAM` package. We use `VGAM` as it includes nice modeling functions for what
amount to Pareto GLM models (although the mathematical details differ).

We mostly work with the distribution functions from VGAM (note the default 
values):

`dparetoI(x, scale = 1, shape = 1, log = FALSE)`    

`dparetoII(x, location = 0, scale = 1, shape = 1, log = FALSE)`   

Unfortunately, these two functions use the 'scale' parameter somewhat
differently.  The 'scale' parameter from `dparetoI()` is related to the
'location' parameter in `dparetoII()`. In each case, it represents the MINIMUM
value of the distribution.  In estimation, the minimum value is often assumed
known.

The reason the terminology changes is that the equivalent `dparetoII()` function 
to a `dparetoI()` example has `location == scale`, so `dparetoI()` needs one
fewer parameters, and the choice of which name to carry in the reduced function
was essentially arbitrary.

Here's an example showing the correspondence. Note the linear decline on a 
log-log plot.  That linear decline is only an identity for a pareto(I)
distribution.
```{r fig.height = 3, fig.width = 4}
ggplot() +
  scale_x_log10(limits = c(0.1,100)) +
  scale_y_log10() +
  geom_function(fun = dparetoI,
                args = list(scale = 2, shape = .5 )) +
geom_function(fun = dparetoII,
                args = list(location = 2, scale = 2, shape = .5 ), 
              color = 'red',
              lty = 2, size = 1)

```

The important distinction is to realize that `paretoII()` has more flexibility
in shape, and in particular the relationship between mean and weight of the
extreme tails.

### Effect of Parameters on Shape of the Distribution
We can get a feel for the implications of shape and scale parameters by plotting
Pareto densities.

```{r pareto_scale_demo, fig.width = 4, fig.height = 3}
ggplot() +
  scale_x_log10(limits = c(1,1000)) +
  #scale_y_log10() +

  theme_cbep(base_size = 10) +
  
  geom_function(fun = dparetoII,
                 args = list(location = 0, scale = 1, shape = 1),
                 color = 'red') +
  geom_function(fun = dparetoII,
                 args = list(location = 0, scale = 2, shape = 1),
                 color = 'orange') +
  geom_function(fun = dparetoII,
                 args = list(location = 0, scale = 5, shape = 1),
                 color = 'yellow') +
  geom_function(fun = dparetoII,
                 args = list(location = 0, scale = 10, shape = 1),
                 color = 'black')
```
So, as SCALE goes up, low values drop, mid and higher values rise.


```{r pareto_shape_demo, fig.width = 4, fig.height = 3}
ggplot() +
  scale_x_log10(limits = c(1,1000)) +
  #scale_y_log10() +

  theme_cbep(base_size = 10) +
  
  geom_function(fun = dparetoII,
                 args = list(location = 0, scale = 5, shape = .1),
                 color = 'red') +
  geom_function(fun = dparetoII,
                 args = list(location = 0, scale = 5, shape = 1),
                 color = 'orange') +
  geom_function(fun = dparetoII,
                 args = list(location = 0, scale = 5, shape = 2),
                 color = 'yellow') +
  geom_function(fun = dparetoII,
                 args = list(location = 0,  scale = 5, shape = 5),
                 color = 'black')
```
The SHAPE parameter has to do with how closely the distribution hugs towards
the "origin" -- more correctly the location parameter, which is the minimum. 

Low shape spreads things out a bit more. High shape pulls things in closely.

A classic Pareto distribution often has `location = scale = 1` has `location = 1`. 

We will often use `location = 0`, and  not constrain the scale parameter.  In 
principal, the value of concentration of bacteria has support on the entire
positive real number line.  It is only because of the limitations of our data
that we have a positive minimum.

### Fitting the Pareto Distribution
#### Fitting Based on Moments
Some comments on closed-form maximum likelihood estimates based on sample
moments can be found here: 
(https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/27426/how-do-i-fit-a-set-of-data-to-a-pareto-distribution-in-r)

Here is the simple function to estimate parameters for a Pareto(I) distribution.
(for non-censored data).  It is from the StackExchange answer referenced above.
The first parameter here is a minimum value, the second, a shape parameter.
```{r}
pareto.MLE <- function(X)
{
   X = X[! is.na(X)]
   n <- length(X)
   m <- min(X, na.rm=TRUE)
   a <- n/sum(log(X)-log(m), na.rm=TRUE)
   return( c(m,a)) 
}

(moment_parms <- pareto.MLE(coli_data$ColiVal_2))
```

#### Fitting the Pareto with `VGAM`
We can also fit a Pareto(II) distribution using `VGAM`. We are fitting a Pareto
distribution with minimum value `location = 0.5` to be as consistent as possible
with the prior.  Note that the PARAMETERS are not very similar at all, which
point to a challenge to interpreting modeling results later. We also note that 
selection of the minimum value has a large effect on fitted parameters.

```{r pareto_fit}
paretofit = vglm(ColiVal_2~ 1, paretoII(location = 0.5) , data = coli_data, maxit = 100)
vgam_parms <- exp(coef(paretofit))
names(vgam_parms) <- c('Scale', 'Shape')
vgam_parms
```

Given scaling issues, it is difficult to compare these three model fits to data.
We (arbitrarily) divide the observed density by 100 to better line up the 
models with the observed data.  All are reasonable, none are obviously correct.

#### Fitting with the `fitdistrplus` Package
The `fitdist()` function provides four methods for fitting a
distribution : "mle", for 'maximum likelihood estimation', "mme" for 'moment
matching estimation', "qme" for 'quantile matching estimation' and "mge" for
'maximum goodness-of-fit estimation'.  Not all appear to work with these data,
and these versions of the Pareto distribution functions, but it is not clear 
why.  

##### MLE Estimation (equivalent to the VGAM Default)
```{r}
f_mle <- fitdist(coli_data$ColiVal_2, "paretoII",
                 method='mle',
                 start = list(shape=1, scale= 1),
                 fix.arg = list(location = 0.5))
cat('\n')
(fd_parms <- f_mle$estimate[c(2,1)])
```

##### Quantile Matching
Quantile matching also works, with a list of quantiles to be matched. Since we
have two parameters to fit, we can ask for fits at two quantiles. It's not
obvious statistically what quantiles make the most sense, but the shellfish
sanitation program is interested in the geometric mean and the p90, Here we
could go with the median and the 90th percentile.  

But note : (1) This does not work with `ColiVal_2`, only with `ColiVal`, and 
(2) resulting parameter estimates look quite different.
```{r}
f_qme <- fitdist(test_dat$ColiVal, "paretoII",
                 method='qme', 
                 probs=c(.50, .90),
              start = list(shape=1, scale=1),
              fix.arg = list(location = 0.5))
cat('\n')
(fd_parms_alt <- f_qme$estimate[c(2,1)])
```
The parameters LOOK quite different from the prior estimate, which is troubling.

### Compare Fits
```{r plot_pareto_fit}
ggplot(coli_data, aes(ColiVal_2)) +

  # geom_histogram(data = coli_data, 
  #               mapping=aes(x=ColiVal_2, y=..density../50), 
  #               fill = NA, color = 'gray20') +
  scale_x_log10(limits = c(.1,100) ) +
 # scale_y_log10(limits = c(10^-4, 2)) +

  theme_cbep(base_size = 10) +
  
  geom_function(fun = dgamma,
                args = list(shape=alpha, scale=theta),
                color = 'orange') + 
  geom_function(fun = dparetoII,
                args = list(location = moment_parms[[1]], scale = moment_parms[[1]],
                             shape = moment_parms[[2]]),
                color = 'red') +
  geom_function(fun = dparetoII,
                args = list(location = .5, scale = vgam_parms[[1]],
                             shape = vgam_parms[[2]]),
                color = 'purple', lwd = 2) +
  geom_function(fun = dparetoII,
                args = list(location = 0.5, scale = fd_parms[[1]],
                             shape = fd_parms[[2]]),
                color = 'yellow', lwd = 1) +
  geom_function(fun = dparetoII,
                args = list(location = 0.5, scale = fd_parms_alt[[1]],
                             shape = fd_parms_alt[[2]]),
                color = 'green')
```

All the different Pareto distribution fits are similar.  Two are effectively 
identical. One lesson is that apparent differences in parameters may have little effect
on the real distribution of probability mass density. 

The gamma distribution (orange) is lower, and has significant mass at low 
(below 1) values.

### Fitting a Pareto Distribution to Censored Data
The FAQ file for the `fitdistplus` files says the following about fitting 
censored data with the `fitdistcens` function):

> Censored data must be represented in the package by a dataframe of two columns
  respectively named left and right, describing each observed value as an
  interval. The left column contains either NA for left censored observations, 
  the left bound of the interval for interval censored observations, or the
  observed value for non-censored observations. The right column contains either
  NA for right censored observations, the right bound of the interval for
  interval censored observations, or the observed value for non-censored
  observations.

The function uses maximum likelihood to estimate parameters.

So, we need to address several cases here for censoring:
1.  Values below 2.0
2.  Discrete nature of values reported by the sampling method, especially at
    lower values
3.  Right censored values that exceed the method upper limit

```{r}
cens_data <- coli_data %>%
  select(ColiVal, LCFlag, RCFlag) %>%
  filter(! is.na(ColiVal)) %>%
  mutate(left  = ifelse(LCFlag, NA, ColiVal)) %>%
  mutate(right = ifelse(RCFlag, NA, ColiVal)) %>%
  select(left,right)
```

We use the `pareto2` family of functions from `actuar`, rather than the 
`paretoII()` functions from `VGAM`, because `actuar` includes a defined moment 
function, `mpareto2()`, and quantile function, `qpareto2()`.  Those functions
are required for several of the alternative fitting algorithms in `fitdistplus`.
```{r error = TRUE}
ff <- fitdistcens(data.frame(cens_data), "pareto2",
                 start = list(shape=1, scale= 1),
                 fix.arg = list(min = 0.5))
cat('\n')
(cens_parms <- ff$estimate[c(2,1)])
```

The parameters are quite different from what we observed fitting to our data
without addressing non-detects directly.  (We DID fit to data with non-detects
replaced by estimated conditional means, but those estimated conditional means
are based on assuming a lognormal distribution, and thus probably overestimate
the conditional means.) 

How different are our estimates with and without explicit modeling of 
non-detects?

```{r plot_pareto_fit_2}
ggplot(coli_data, aes(ColiVal_2)) +

  # geom_histogram(data = coli_data, 
  #               mapping=aes(x=ColiVal_2, y=..density../50), 
  #               fill = NA, color = 'gray20') +
  scale_x_log10(limits = c(.1,100) ) +
  # scale_y_log10(limits = c(10^-4, 3)) +

  theme_cbep(base_size = 10) +

  geom_function(fun = dparetoII,
                 args = list(location = 0.5, scale = fd_parms[[1]],
                             shape = fd_parms[[2]]),
                color = 'blue', lwd = 1) +
  geom_function(fun = dparetoII,
                args = list(location = 0.5, scale = fd_parms_alt[[1]],
                             shape = fd_parms_alt[[2]]),
                color = 'purple') +
  geom_function(fun = dparetoII,
                 args = list(location = 0.5, scale = cens_parms[[1]],
                             shape =cens_parms[[2]]),
                color = 'red')
```

So, explicit modeling of non-detects flattens out the curve a fair amount,
with the largest effects reducing probability at low values and increasing 
them at slightly higher values.  The revised curve looks a LOT like the curve
fit to the median and 90th percentile.

### Means and Variances
These don't work very well for these estimated sets of parameters because
estimated parameters are low enough so both the mean and the variance of the
fitted Pareto distribution are unbounded.
```{r}
est_pareto_mean <- function(scale, shape, location){
  if_else(shape > 1,
          location + (scale / (shape - 1)),
          NaN)
}
est_pareto_variance <- function(scale, shape, location){
  if_else(shape > 1, 
          if_else(shape>2,
                  scale^2 * shape / ((shape - 1)^2 * (shape - 2)),
                  Inf),
          NaN)
}

```

#### Maximum Likelihood
```{r}
fd_parms
est_pareto_mean(fd_parms[[1]], fd_parms[[2]], 0.5)
est_pareto_variance(fd_parms[[1]], fd_parms[[2]], 0.5)
```
# Quantile matching
```{r}
fd_parms_alt
est_pareto_mean(fd_parms_alt[[1]], fd_parms_alt[[2]], 0.5)
est_pareto_variance(fd_parms_alt[[1]], fd_parms_alt[[2]], 0.5)
```
# Maximum Likelihood with Censored Data

```{r}
cens_parms
est_pareto_mean(cens_parms[[1]], cens_parms[[2]], 0.5)
est_pareto_variance(cens_parms[[1]], cens_parms[[2]], 0.5)
```

# Conclusions
While it is clear that the bacteria data has much in common with a Pareto 
distribution, procedures for fitting that distribution to data are convoluted, 
and results difficult to interpret, as there is no simple relationship between
parameters and simple summary statistics.  Further, fitted parameters are 
strongly influenced by analytic choices, such as selecting which version of the
Pareto distribution to fit, and setting the Location parameter.

# Introduction
The bacteria data is highly skewed. We have found no ready way to estimate a
geometric mean for these data in a robust way.  The data appears distributed
close to a Pareto distribution, which is highly skewed, with a heavy right tail.
This distribution is likely to be difficult to model, so we can not readily
estimate parameters, moments and other summary statistics.

One possibility would be to run some sort of (generalized) linear model on the
log of data, calculate means and medians, and back transform. I hope to explore
both linear model approaches in another R Notebook.

Here we take another approach, which is to focus on binomial, quasi-binomial,
and multinomial proportional odds models to estimate probabilities of exceeding
different regulatory thresholds.

## Growing Area Classification Standards

Growing Area Classification | Activity Allowed              |	Geometric mean FC/100ml	| 90th Percentile (P90) FC/100ml
----------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------------
Approved	               | Harvesting allowed	                  | ≤ 14	              | ≤ 31
Conditionally Approved	 | Harvesting allowed except during specified conditions | ≤ 14 in open status	| ≤ 31 in open status
Restricted	             | Depuration harvesting or relay only	| ≤ 88 and >15	      | ≤ 163 and > 31
Conditionally Restricted | Depuration harvesting or relay allowed except during specified conditions	| ≤ 88 in open status	| ≤ 163 in open status
Prohibited	             | Aquaculture seed production only	    | >88	                |>163

So, critical levels for Geometric Mean include:

*  $GM \leq 14$: Approved, or Open status at Conditionally Approved sites

*  $GM \leq 88$: Depuration harvesting or Relay Only

*  $GM > 88$ : Prohibited

And for the p90:

*  $P90 < 31$    Approved or Open status at Conditionally Approved

*  $P90 \leq 163$  Depuration harvesting or Relay Only

*  $P90 > 163$   Prohibited



### Maine State Class SB Waters Standards
Maine's water quality criteria includes an additional standard, which applies
only indirectly to these data:  
> the number of enterococcus bacteria in these waters may not exceed a geometric
  mean of 8 CFU per 100   milliliters in any 90-day interval or 54 CFU per 100
  milliliters in more than 10% of the samples in any 90-day interval.
  
  38 M.R.S. §465-B(2)(B)

A "90 day interval" might apply to a summer's worth of data, but in most years 
that will only represent a handful of observations at each site, so it is of 
limited value.

## Main Data
```{r}
sibfldnm <- 'Derived_Data'
parent <- dirname(getwd())
sibling <- file.path(parent,sibfldnm)
fl1<- "Shellfish data 2015 2018.csv"
path <- file.path(sibling, fl1)

coli_data <- read_csv(path, 
  col_types = cols(SDate = col_date(format = "%Y-%m-%d"), 
        SDateTime = col_datetime(format = "%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ"), # Note Format!

  mutate(Month = factor(Month, levels = 1:12, labels = month.abb)) %>%
  rename_with(tolower)
```

### Remove NAs
```{r}
coli_data <- coli_data %>%
  filter (! is.na(colival))
```

## Weather Data
We simplify the weather data somewhat.
```{r load_weather_data}
sibfldnm    <- 'Original_Data'
parent      <- dirname(getwd())
sibling     <- file.path(parent,sibfldnm)

fn <- "Portland_Jetport_2015-2019.csv"
fpath <- file.path(sibling, fn)

weather_data <- read_csv(fpath, 
 col_types = cols(AWNDattr = col_skip(), 
        FMTM = col_skip(), FMTMattr = col_skip(), 
        PGTM = col_skip(), PGTMattr = col_skip(),
        PRCPattr = col_character(), SNOWattr = col_character(), 
        SNWD = col_skip(), SNWDattr = col_skip(),
        TAVG = col_number(), TAVGattr = col_character(), 
        TMIN = col_number(), TMINattr = col_character(), 
        TMAX = col_number(), TMAXattr = col_character(), 
        station = col_skip())) %>%
  select( ! starts_with('W')) %>%
  select(! ends_with('attr')) %>%
  rename(sdate = date,
         Precip=PRCP,
         MaxT = TMAX,
         MinT= TMIN,
         AvgT = TAVG,
         Snow = SNOW) %>%
  mutate(sdate = as.Date(sdate, format = '%m/%d/%Y'))
```

```{r}
weather_data <- weather_data %>%
  arrange(sdate) %>%
  
  select(sdate, Precip, AvgT, MaxT) %>%
  mutate(AvgT = AvgT / 10,
         MaxT = MaxT / 10,
         Precip = Precip / 10,
         Precip_d1 = dplyr::lag(Precip,1),
         Precip_d2 = dplyr::lag(Precip,2),
         Log1Precip    = log1p(Precip), 
         Log1Precip_d1 = log1p(Precip_d1),
         Log1Precip_d2 = log1p(Precip_d2),
         Log1Precip_2   = log1p(Precip_d1 + Precip_d2),
         Log1Precip_3   = log1p(Precip + Precip_d1 + Precip_d2)) %>%
  rename_with(tolower)
```

## Incorporate Weather Data
```{r}
coli_data <- coli_data %>%
  left_join(weather_data, by = 'sdate')
```

## Remove Sites not in Region
We have some data that was selected for stations outside of Casco Bay. To be  
careful, we  remove sampling data for any site in th two adjacent Growing Areas,
"WH" and "WM".
```{r}
coli_data <- coli_data %>%
  filter(grow_area != 'WH' & grow_area != "WM") %>%
  mutate(grow_area = fct_drop(grow_area))
```


## Calculate Indicator Variables
Here we calculate variables that indicate whether each sample exceeds our four
thresholds.  Then they are combined to produce three multinomial ordered
factors.

The key thresholds are these:
```{r}
coli_limits <- list(open = 0,   gmrelay=14,    p90relay=31, 
                    gmclosed=88, p90closed=163, high= 50000)
```


We create a data frame containing a number of binomial and multinomial 
responses.  

*  The first four are binary responses, showing whether each
   individual sample meets or fails to meet a single standard.  Since the standards
   are written to apply to long-term records, that is not 100% legitimate,
   especially for the geometric mean standards, but it is what we have to work
   with.  We can apply the p90 standard by ensuring that the probability of
   exceeding that threshold is less than 0.90.

*  The next three variables are multinomial responses that classify variables
   into a sequence of of ordered categories

```{r}
freq_data <- coli_data %>%
  mutate(gm_open   = colival <= coli_limits$gmrelay,
         gm_relay  = colival <= coli_limits$gmclosed,
         p90_open  = colival <= coli_limits$p90relay,
         p90_relay = colival <= coli_limits$p90closed) %>%
  mutate(all_lvls = cut(colival, coli_limits,
                    labels = c('open', 'gm_relay', 'p90_relay', 
                               'gm_closed', 'p90_closed'),
                    ordered_result = TRUE)) %>%
  mutate(p90_lvls = cut(colival, coli_limits[c(1,3,5,6)], 
                    labels = c('p90open', 'p90relay', 'p90closed'),
                    ordered_result = TRUE)) %>%
  mutate(gm_lvls = cut(colival, coli_limits[c(1,2,4,6)], 
                      labels = c('gmopen', 'gmrelay', 'gmclosed'),
                      ordered_result = TRUE))
```

```{r}
freq_data <- freq_data %>% 
  select(-coliscore, -rawcoli, -lcflag, -rcflag, -colival)
```


## Raw Station Probabilitiies
We want to be able to compare the results of modeling to observed relative
frequencies of meeting or exceeding standards, so we want a simple data frame
containing those probabilities.  We structured our binomial observations
with TRUE = open, so these are probabilities of meeting standards.

```{r}
rawprobs <- freq_data %>%
  group_by(station) %>%
  summarize(grow_area = first(grow_area),
            p_gm_open  = sum(gm_open)/sum(! is.na(gm_open)),
            p_p90_open = sum(p90_open)/sum(! is.na(p90_open)),
            p_gm_relay  = sum(gm_relay)/sum(! is.na(gm_relay)),
            p_p90_relay = sum(p90_relay)/sum(! is.na(p90_relay)))

lowerfun <- function(data, mapping){
  ggplot(data = data, mapping = mapping)+
    geom_point() +
    geom_abline(slope = 1, intercept = 0) +
    scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0,1)) +
    scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0,1))
  }  

rawprobs %>%
  select(-station, - grow_area) %>%
  ggpairs(lower = list(continuous = wrap(lowerfun)),
          progress = FALSE) +
  theme_cbep(base_size = 10)

 
```

Which looks pretty good.  Recall that the reason the points are all above 
the 1:1 line is that it is impossible to exceed the higher standard without
also exceeding the lower threshold.  Note the relatively high correlations.

That one extreme value probably corresponds to the one very high geometric mean 
site we already observed.

## Add Imperviousness Data
```{r load_imperv_data}
sibfldnm    <- 'Derived_Data'
parent      <- dirname(getwd())
sibling     <- file.path(parent,sibfldnm)

fn <- "station_imperviousness.csv"
fpath <- file.path(sibling, fn)

imperv_data <- read_csv(fpath) %>%
  select(Station, pct_1000, pct_500, pct_100, pct_l_1000, pct_l_500, pct_l_100)
```
```{r}
freq_data <- freq_data %>%
  mutate(s = as.character(station)) %>%
  left_join(imperv_data, by = c('s' = 'Station')) %>%
  select (-s)

rawprobs<- rawprobs %>%
  mutate(s = as.character(station)) %>%
  left_join(imperv_data, by = c('s' = 'Station')) %>%
  select (-s)

rm(imperv_data)
```


# Exploratory Graphics
```{r}
freq_data %>% select(month, all_lvls) %>%
  ggpairs(aes(month, all_lvls)) 
```

1. Most observations are from summer months
2. Most observations are lower than all our cut points
3. Probability of exceedences appears slightly higher in summer months.

```{r fig.width = 5, fig.height = 3}
freq_data %>%
  count(month, all_lvls) %>%
  ggplot(aes(month, n, fill=all_lvls)) +
   geom_bar(stat = "identity", position='fill') +
  theme_minimal()
```

```{r fig.width = 5, fig.height = 3}
freq_data %>%
  count(month, p90_open) %>%
  ggplot(aes(month, n, fill= p90_open )) +
   geom_bar(stat = "identity", position='fill') +
  theme_minimal()
```

# Utility Functions
Remember the coefficients of a binomial GLM are actually the logit of the 
probabilities we are interested in, so a couple of utility functions come in 
handy. These are probably not the most numerically stable versions of these
functions for extreme values, but they work.
```{r}
logit <- function(p) {log(p)-log(1-p)}
inv_logit <- function(x) {1/(1+exp(-x))}
```

# Cleanup
We remove unnecessary data frames to free memory for calculations.
```{r}
rm(coli_data, coli_limits, weather_data)
```

# Modeling
We can explore three different modeling strategies:
1. A binomial GLM for exceedences of the gm_mean and p90 thresholds.
2. A multinomial proportional odds model using the `polr()` function from `MASS`
or `vglm()` from `VGAM`.

Ideally, we should account for different sampling histories to provide robust
comparable estimates of site probabilities.

## Binomial Models
We focus on the probability of meeting the lower p90 threshold (`p90_open`).
That threshold has potential consequences. If the probability of
violating that standard is high enough (> 90%) the site would have to be 
approved only for relay. Stations failed the higher `p90_relay` standard so 
rarely that we run into problems with modeling.

It is less clear how we would relate the probability of violating the Geometric
Mean standards to our models.  


### Station Only
We start with a simple model looking only at stations. The probability of 
failing a standard may be an appropriate way to symbolize stations in GIS.
```{r}
system.time(p90_open_glm_1 <- glm(p90_open  ~ station,
             data = freq_data,
             family=binomial(link=logit)))
```

```{r}
anova(p90_open_glm_1, test='LRT')
```

By the LRT, differences among station are highly significant.

```{r}
p_res <- summary(emmeans(p90_open_glm_1, "station", 
                        type = 'response')) %>%
  mutate(station = fct_reorder(station, prob)) %>%
  arrange(station)


plot(p_res) +
  
  theme_cbep(base_size = 12) + 
  theme(axis.text.y = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.y = element_blank(),
        axis.line  = element_line(size = 0.5, 
                                  color = 'gray85'),
        panel.grid.major.x = element_line(size = 0.5, 
                                          color = 'gray85', 
                                          linetype = 2)) +
  
  ylab('Station') +
  xlab('Probability of Meeting\nP90 Standard' )

```
Many sites show unstable standard errors, as they were never observed with 
a sample that failed the standard, triggering a Hauke-Donner effect.  That
makes estimation of parameters and standard errors effectively impossible for 
those sites.  We can treat them as P = 1.0 for practical purposes in a model 
like this.

```{r}
tmp <- rawprobs %>%
  left_join(p_res, by = 'station')

ggplot(tmp, aes(p_p90_open, prob)) +
    geom_pointrange(mapping = aes(ymin = asymp.LCL, ymax =asymp.UCL)) +
    geom_abline(intercept = 0, slope = 1) +
    scale_x_continuous(limits = c(.5,1)) +
    scale_y_continuous(limits = c(.5,1))
```
In a simple model, the predictions match the observed relative frequencies and
the standard errors behave as expected (wider near the middle of a binomial 
distribution, narrower and asymmetrical near the limits).

### Region Model
For more complex models, we treat Stations as random factors, using the `gam()`
function, which can fit random factors using a smoothing term with basis 
designated as `bs = 're'`.  This helps protect against making claims on the 
basis of the specific stations from which data are available.
```{r region_model, cache = TRUE}
system.time(
  p90_open_gam_regions <- gam(p90_open  ~ grow_area + s(station, bs = 're'),
             data = freq_data,
             family=binomial(link=logit))
  )
```

```{r}
anova(p90_open_gam_regions, test='LRT')
```
By the LRT, differences among regions are highly significant, as expected.

```{r}
p_res <- summary(emmeans(p90_open_gam_regions, "grow_area", 
                         nesting = " station %in% grow_area",
                        type = 'response'))

plot(p_res) +
  ylab('Region') +
  xlab('Probability of Meeting\nP90 Standard' )
  

```

#### Draft Graphic
```{r plot_regions_emm}
plt <- ggplot(p_res, aes(grow_area, prob)) + 
  geom_jitter(data = rawprobs,
              mapping = aes(y = p_p90_open),
              height = 0, width = 0.4, color = cbep_colors()[5] ) +
  geom_pointrange(aes(ymin = lower.CL, ymax = upper.CL),
                  fill = cbep_colors()[2], size = .75, shape = 23) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0.9, color = 'gray85', lty =2, size = 1) +
  
  ylab('Probability Each Site Meets \nP90 E. coli Standard') +
  xlab('Maine DMR Growing Area') +

  theme_cbep(base_size = 12)

plt
```


### Season Model
```{r season_model, cache = TRUE}
system.time(p90_open_gam_months <- gam(p90_open ~ month + s(station, bs = 're'),
             data = freq_data,
             family=binomial(link=logit)))
```

```{r}
anova(p90_open_gam_months)
```

We see strong evidence that time of year matters, as expected from our analysis 
of geometric means.

```{r}
mm <- emmeans(p90_open_gam_months, "month", type = 'response')
mms <- summary(mm)  # Summary has class dataframe, making access and display easier.
```


#### Draft Graphic
We have a problem here, as Stations are not contained "within" months, so sites
are not uniquely attributable to them.  Accordingly, we can not use the strategy
of the prior graphic to show both Stations and Months.

```{r plot_months_emm}
plt <- ggplot(mms, aes(month, prob)) + 
  geom_pointrange(aes(ymin = lower.CL, ymax = upper.CL),
                  fill = cbep_colors()[2], size = .75, shape = 23) +
  geom_line(aes(x = as.numeric(month)), color =  cbep_colors()[3]) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0.9, color = 'gray85', lty =2, size = 1) +
  
  xlab('') + 
  ylab(expression(atop('Probability of Meeting', 
                           'P90' ~ italic('E. coli') ~ 'Standard'))) +
  
  ylim(0.75, 1.0) +

  theme_cbep(base_size = 12)

plt
```

### Rainfall Model
Again, we artificially reduce the number of degrees of freedom associated with
each smoother to make them less wiggly.
```{r rainfall_model, cache = TRUE}
system.time(
  p90_open_gam_rain <- gam(p90_open ~ s(log1precip, k = 5) + 
                             s(log1precip_d1, k = 5) + 
                             s(station, bs = 're'),
                           data = freq_data,
                           family=binomial(link=logit)))
```

```{r}
gam.check(p90_open_gam_rain)
```

```{r}
anova(p90_open_gam_rain)
```

We see strong evidence that rainfall matters, as expected from our analysis 
of geometric means.  Both current day rainfall and prior day rainfall matter.
Relationship of the linear predictors with rainfall are close to linear, except
at the extremes.

```{r}
summary(p90_open_gam_rain)
```


```{r}
plot(p90_open_gam_rain)
```

### Imperviousness Models
Is risk of failing standards related to local land use, as indexed by 
imperviousness?  We examine value of percent imperviousness as a predictor of
risk.

#### Exploratory Graphic
We display the horizontal axis using a square root transform, which is may
stabilize the variation of a percentage.  
```{r fig.width  = 7}
rawprobs %>%
  select(p_p90_open, starts_with('pct_')) %>%
  pivot_longer(starts_with('pct_'), 
               names_to = 'category', 
               values_to = 'value') %>%
  ggplot(aes(value, p_p90_open)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.25) +
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm') +
  #scale_x_sqrt() +
  facet_wrap(~category, nrow = 2, scales = 'free_x')
```

While those almost all suggest a decline in probability of meeting standards
with imperviousness, the relationships rest on the large number of sites that 
never fail the standard at low impervious cover.

Intellectually, I prefer the land based IC values.  There is no great way to 
decide which range makes the most sense.  A full km (1000 m) feels like a long 
way on the narrow peninsulas of the Eastern Bay.


#### Models
Here, we need to model each station, since risk is a station by station
property.  We could treat Stations as either random or fixed factors, but it is
more intellectually honest to acknowledge that we want to draw lessons about a
larger population of possible sampling locations.  We treat Stations as random
factors.

We run all three distances, using land-based percent cover estimates. First,
with untransformed percent cover values.
```{r imperv_models_1, cache = TRUE}
system.time(imp_100 <- gam(p90_open ~ pct_l_100 + s(station, bs = 're'),
             data = freq_data,
             family=binomial(link=logit)))
system.time(imp_500 <- gam(p90_open ~ pct_l_500 + s(station, bs = 're'),
             data = freq_data,
             family=binomial(link=logit)))
system.time(imp_1000 <- gam(p90_open ~ pct_l_1000 + s(station, bs = 're'),
             data = freq_data,
             family=binomial(link=logit)))
```

```{r}
anova(imp_100)
cat('\n\n')
anova(imp_500)
cat('\n\n')
anova(imp_1000)
```

The only version that shows a statistically robust response is the 1000 meter 
model.  The other s are not significant.

Now we run similar models on the square root of percent cover.
```{r imperv_models_2, cache = TRUE}
system.time(imp_100_t <- gam(p90_open ~ sqrt(pct_l_100) + s(station, bs = 're'),
             data = freq_data,
             family=binomial(link=logit)))
system.time(imp_500_t <- gam(p90_open ~ sqrt(pct_l_500) + s(station, bs = 're'),
             data = freq_data,
             family=binomial(link=logit)))
system.time(imp_1000_t <- gam(p90_open ~ sqrt(pct_l_1000) + s(station, bs = 're'),
             data = freq_data,
             family=binomial(link=logit)))
```



```{r}
anova(imp_100_t)
cat('\n\n')
anova(imp_500_t)
cat('\n\n')
anova(imp_1000_t)
```

Again, only the 1000 meter version shows significant patterns with land use.

The square root transform makes almost no difference regarding the adequacy of 
the fit.
```{r}
anova(imp_1000, imp_1000_t)
```

We continue with the untransformed model, as easier to explain to our audience.

```{r}
summary(imp_1000)
```

We extract regularly spaced predictions with `emmeans()`. This simplifies 
averaging across stations, and correctly incorporates the station by station
errors.

```{r}
mm <- emmeans(imp_1000, "pct_l_1000",
              at = list(pct_l_1000 = seq(0, 20, 0.5)), type = 'response')
mms <- summary(mm)  # Summary has class dataframe, making access and display easier.
```


#### Graphic
```{r}
rawprobs %>%
  select(pct_l_1000, p_p90_open) %>%
  ggplot(aes(pct_l_1000, p_p90_open)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.25, color = cbep_colors()[4]) +

  geom_line(data = mms, mapping = aes(x = pct_l_1000, y = prob)) +
  xlab('Percent Impervious, 1000 m') +
  ylab('Prob. Meeting P90 Standard') +
  theme_cbep(base_size= 12)


```
So, the relationship is statistically significant, but not especially striking 
or robust.  There is a lot of scatter, and the trend is driven mostly by (a) the
frequency of sites that never see bad water quality, and (b) a handful of sites
with high imperviousness.


#### Cleanup
```{r}
rm(imperv_data,
   tmp, plt, mm, mms, p_res, 
   p90_open_glm_1, p90_open_gam_months, p90_open_gam_regions,
   p90_open_gam_rain, imp_100, imp_100_t, imp_500, imp_500_t, imp_1000, imp_1000_t,
   lowerfun)
```

## Proportional Odds Models
We explore proportional odds models to see if they provide any further insight.

### Summary of the Data
```{r}
summ <- as_tibble(ftable(xtabs(~ grow_area + all_lvls, data = freq_data))) %>%
  group_by(grow_area) %>%
  mutate(Prop = Freq / sum(Freq)) %>%
  ungroup()
summ
```

```{r}
ggplot(summ, aes(x = grow_area, fill = all_lvls, y = Prop)) +
  geom_col(size = .75, position = 'dodge')  +
  theme_cbep(base_size = 12)
```


### Region Models

#### Using `VGAM`
VGAM does not allow for random effects. A model fitting station %in% grow_area
bogged down with high memory usage.  

##### Basic Model
The parameter `parallel = TRUE` in the family function sets this up as a
proportional odds model.  The cutpoints for all regions are proportional.
```{r}
system.time(
  pom_region <- vglm(all_lvls ~ grow_area,
                     data = freq_data,
                     family = cumulative(link = "logitlink",
                                         parallel = TRUE,
                                         reverse = FALSE))
)
```
```{r}
summary(pom_region)
```

##### Model Framework
The estimated model can be written as:

$$
\begin{aligned}
logit( \text{open | gm_relay}) = logit( \hat{P}(Y <= 1)) =  1.46 + \beta_i \\
logit( \text{gm_relay | p90_relay}) = logit( \hat{P}(Y <= 2)) =  2.07 + \beta_i \\
logit( \text{p90_relay | gm_closed}) = logit( \hat{P}(Y <= 3)) =  2.95 + \beta_i \\
logit( \text{gm_closed | p90_closed}) = logit( \hat{P}(Y <= 4)) =  3.66 + \beta_i \\
\end{aligned}
$$

Where the $\beta_i$ are log odds between the base case (here "WI") and the other
cases.  It is hard to interpret those coefficients in the absence of the other
coefficients.

Each of the  "cutpoints" (shown numerically) is the log odds of being
below the threshold between levels.  There for the probability of 
having better water quality.

##### Alternate (Non-proportional) Model
```{r}
system.time(
  om_region<- vglm(all_lvls ~ grow_area,
                     data = freq_data,
                     family = cumulative(link = "logitlink",
                                         parallel = FALSE,
                                         reverse = FALSE))
)
```

##### Compare Models
```{r}
AIC(pom_region)
AIC(om_region)
```

The proportional odds model is better by AIC, as it uses fewer parameters, and 
does nearly as good a job fitting the data.

##### Interpretation
We can look at predicted (conditional) probabilities. We work through the logic
of the models, to clarify the structure of the model predictions.

First, we calculate the log odds ratios. This is the linear predictor generated
by hte model. These are log odds of being below each "cutpoint." 
```{r}
pp <- predict(pom_region, 
              newdata = data.frame(grow_area = c('WI', 'WJ', 'WK', 'WL')))
pp
```

Then we convert from log odds to probabilities ob being below each threshold.
```{r}
pp <- inv_logit(pp)
colnames(pp) <- c('p[<=1]', 'p[<=2]', 'p[<=3]', 'p[<=5]')
rownames(pp) <- c('WI', 'WJ', 'WK', 'WL')
pp
```

And finally, we find the differences between successive threshold
probabilities to generate probabilities of observing each outcome.
```{r}
pp <- cbind(pp, 1)
ppp <- pp
colnames(ppp) <- c('p = 1', 'p = 2', 'p = 3', 'p = 4', 'p = 5')
for (i in 2:5)
  ppp[,i] <- pp[,i] - pp[,i-1]

ppp
```

You can spit out the same type of prediction of probabilities  from `VGAM` using 
parameter `type = 'response'`.

We use that to look at results from the complete odds model, which are nearly
identical, as suggested by the very similar AIC values we calculated before.
```{r}
pp <- predict(om_region, 
              newdata = data.frame(grow_area = c('WI', 'WJ', 'WK', 'WL')),
              type = 'response')
pp
```

### Using MASS
We can fit the same model using the `polr()` function from `MASS`. The primary 
difference are:  
1.  `polr()` can not fit the non-proportional odds model we fit as an alternate
    in `vglm()`.
2.  `polr()` parameterizes the model in a different  way, so the model
    parameters are the negative of what was generated in `vglm()`.
3.  `MASS` provides the  option of producing predicted probabilities with the 
    `type = 'p'` parameter to the 'predict.polr()` function, rather than the 
    `type = 'response'` parameter used by `VGAM`.
4.  `vglm()` has many more models and alternate forms for presenting the data,
    making it both more flexible, and easier to misapply.
```{r}
system.time(
  polr_region <- polr(all_lvls ~ grow_area,
                    data = freq_data, Hess = TRUE,
                    method = "logistic")
)
```
```{r}
summary(polr_region)
```
MASS provides an option of predicting the probabilities with the `type = 'p'`
parameter to the 'predict.polr()` function.
```{r}
pp <- predict(polr_region, 
              newdata = data.frame(grow_area = c('WI', 'WJ', 'WK', 'WL')),
              type = 'p')
pp
```

### Rainfall Models
We continue examing models of the impact of 
#### Full model
```{r}
system.time(
  pom_rain <- vglm(all_lvls ~ log1precip + log1precip_d1,
                     data = freq_data,
                     family = cumulative(link = "logitlink",
                                         parallel = TRUE,
                                         reverse = FALSE))
)
```
```{r}
summary(pom_rain)
```
#### Simplified Model
```{r}
system.time(
  pom_rain_2 <- vglm(all_lvls ~ log1p(precip + precip_d1),
                     data = freq_data,
                     family = cumulative(link = "logitlink",
                                         parallel = TRUE,
                                         reverse = FALSE))
)
```

```{r}
AIC(pom_rain)
AIC(pom_rain_2)
```
So the full model is preferable.  But other than acknowledging the fact that 
rain matters, the magnitude of the effects is modest.

```{r}
summary(pom_rain)
```
The easiest way to interpret these results is in terms of how the probability
that a sample meets all standards changes with rainfall.
```{r}
rain_df <- tibble(precip = rep(seq(0,2, 0.25),5),
                      log1precip = log1p(precip),
                      precip_d1 = rep(seq(0,2,0.5),each = 9),
                      log1precip_d1 = log1p(precip_d1))

pp <- predict(pom_rain, 
              newdata = rain_df,
              type = 'response')
rain_df <- rain_df %>% cbind(pp)
```

```{r}
rain_df %>%
  
   ggplot(aes(x = precip, y = open, color = factor(precip_d1))) +  
   geom_line() +
   
   scale_y_log10(limits = c(.75,1)) +
  
   
   theme_cbep(base_size = 12) +
   theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90)) +
  
   labs(color = "Yesterday's\nPrecipitation\n(in)",
       y = 'Probability a Sample Meets All Criteria',
       x = "Today's Precipitation")
  
```

Or, to put it another way, (and not graphically), rainfall drops the probability
of meeting all criteria from `r max(rain_df$open)` to `r min(rain_df$open)`, by
the same token, it increases the risk of any single observation exceeding all
the thresholds from `r min(rain_df$p90_closed)` to `r max(rain_df$p90_closed)`.

```{r}
max(rain_df$open)
min(rain_df$open)
min(rain_df$p90_closed)
max(rain_df$p90_closed)
```

Expressed in odds, about one on fourteen samples fails the lowest standard when
there has been no recent rain, which after a couple of days of heavy rain, that
climbs to about one in six.  Conversely, only about one in 141 samples fails
the highest (P90) standard without recent rain, which more than doubles to about 
1 in 56 after heavy rain.

```{r}
max(rain_df$open)/ (1- max(rain_df$open))
min(rain_df$open)/ (1- min(rain_df$open))

# Since our highest standard is an "exceeds" probability, we calculate the
# inverse odds for interpretation purposes.
(1- max(rain_df$p90_closed))/ max(rain_df$p90_closed)
(1- min(rain_df$p90_closed))/min(rain_df$p90_closed)

```

Of course, those odds are across all samples, and conditions at some individual
station will be worse.  Conversely, many station never fail standards.


# Further Questions
More complex models (region by rainfall, site by rainfall, weighted rainfall
models, etc.) are possible.  Such models could be either binomial or 
proportional odds models. However, further analyses are unlikely to 
qualitatively alter our understanding of patterns. 

The one additional question that could be interesting to examine would be to
look at whether the impact of rainfall differs from Station to Station or
Growing Area to Growing Area.
